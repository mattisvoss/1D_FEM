# 1D_FEM
Python classes defining a 1D linear finite element solver for second order ODEs

This notebook contains classes for the solution of steady, 2nd order, linear ODE's in one dimension. The code uses Lagrange interpolation polynomials. It includes an example solution of the steady-state homogeneous heat equation with conduction and advection terms.

The code is based on the discussion in a set of presentation [slides](http://www.math.pitt.edu/~sussmanm/3040Summer14/FEM1D.pdf) by M.M. Sussman, University of Pittsburgh, accessed 23/02/2022. The slides are incomplete and were used mainly as a guide to build a class architecture for the problem. The lecture notes in turn are based on code from the [FEniCS project](https://fenicsproject.org). Notebook author: Mattis Voss
